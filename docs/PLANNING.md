# FeelFlick — Active Sprint

> **Update this file yourself at the end of every work session.**
> Claude Code reads this at session start — keep it honest and current.
> Do NOT ask Claude to auto-update this file.

> **Now driven by the phased rebuild.** The full F0–F10 roadmap (objectives, scope,
> non-scope, validation, risk) lives in
> [feelflick-foundation-readiness-audit.md §8](feelflick-foundation-readiness-audit.md).
> This file tracks only the *active* slice — don't duplicate the roadmap here.

## Currently In Progress
- [ ] (between phases) — F3 just landed; F4 is queued.

## Up Next (prioritized)
- [ ] **F4 — Landing + Onboarding vNext** — also the natural home for the parked
      landing-reusability WIP in `stash@{0}` (Eyebrow rollout + `AuthCTA`/`Wordmark`
      primitives + `Reveal`→`useInView`), applied with deliberate visual re-baselining.
- [ ] (later) F5–F10 per the F0 roadmap.

## Blocked / Waiting
- [ ] <!-- e.g. Feature X — waiting on design decision -->

## Done This Week
- [x] **F3 — Design System Hardening** (`docs/design-system-hardening-f3.md`): retired
      genuine brand-ambient/accent drift (router `LandingBg`, SearchBar hover,
      ErrorBoundary → sanctioned `red`); documented brand-vs-semantic tokens (amber/
      red/green kept as load-bearing semantics); exported `Eyebrow` from `@/shared/ui`;
      added a tokens contract test. Inline `HP` holdouts were already resolved
      (Discover + browse spread `baseHP`). `stash@{0}` reviewed, left intact, not applied.
- [x] **F2 — Information Architecture v2** (`docs/ia-v2-decision-record.md`): nav now
      encodes the surface hierarchy — mobile bottom-nav hero moved Discover →
      **Tonight** (`/home`); desktop pills reduced to Tonight · Discover · DNA
      (Browse/Watchlist demoted to the account menu); "Home" → "Tonight" label.
      Routes/guards unchanged. Added a `BottomNav` IA-contract test.
- [x] **F1 — Product Doctrine + README/Docs Alignment** (`docs/product-doctrine.md`,
      `docs/product-research-patterns.md`; README/architecture/overview reconciled).
- [x] F0 — Foundation Readiness Audit (`docs/feelflick-foundation-readiness-audit.md`).
- [x] chore: npm audit clean — `npm audit` reports **0 vulnerabilities** (resolved).
- [x] fix: ESLint clean — `npm run lint` passes with 0 warnings (the prior
      rules-of-hooks ×8 + no-unescaped-entities ×47 backlog is resolved).
- [x] fix: `recommendations.helpers.test.js` now passes in the standard suite
      (full unit suite green: 417 tests / 33 files).
